  "description": "The eye reprisents envy and the squares changing color represent where you are and how envy follows you. For the coding part i used the square example and took away the noLoop because I wanted there to be constant movement along with this i changed the variance and stroke. I also used the CC complexity example and made it look like an eye by drawing more ellipses. To make the squares change colours i utilised the mouse hover logic we learned while making our games in year 1."

    "description": "I tried to create a memory of mine from summer. We have a pond in our backyard surrounded by all these beautiful flowers and i was walking there one night and saw a single lilly growing in the middle of the pond. It was small but beautiful and resonated deeply with me. To create this i used the example of the noise dots from class and added some squares in various shades of blue to imitate that reflection of light on water as well as adjusting the sizes and framerate. on top this i used the flower example from class to try and imitate the little pink lily by adjusting the code according to my vision"

This was made by combining the noise example from class and changing the size, color and opacity as well as adding additional rectangles. the petals were made using garrits flow field 03 example and changing the color and opacity as well as randomising the stroke width to get a fluttering effect.ÃŸ"
